// Exercise 5
// Is it possible to change an object declared with const, how do you think and why?

// JAVASCRIPT
const user = {
    name: "John"
}

// does it work?
user.name = "Pete"

// Yes, it will work. It is not possible to reassingn a 'const', althought it is possible to change the properties of a 'const' object.
